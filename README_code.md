### üéØ Mission

Enable fast, AI-assisted detection of white blood cell types from images to support blood-related diagnostics and research.

---



## üì∏ How It Works

üñºÔ∏è Users upload an image of a white blood cell.

ü§ñ The AI model (based on MobileNetV2 and TensorFlow) classifies the cell as one of:

* **Eosinophil**
* **Lymphocyte**
* **Monocyte**
* **Neutrophil**

‚úÖ The model returns an **instant prediction** along with the displayed image, enabling rapid analysis.
